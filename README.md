#Real-Time-OS-Health-monitor


The OS Health Monitoring System will be designed as a Flask-based REST API that fetches 
system metrics using psutil and serves data to a web dashboard. The frontend will utilize HTML, 
CSS, JavaScript, and Chart.js for visualization. We will use AJAX polling or WebSockets to 
refresh data in real time. Deployment options include local servers or cloud platforms like AWS 
or Heroku. Security measures such as CORS handling and authentication may be implemented 
for controlled access. 
Technologies Used: 
• Backend: Python (Flask), psutil 
• Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Chart.js) 
• Communication: AJAX / WebSockets 
• Deployment: Local machine / Cloud (Heroku, AWS)
